### üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm looking to collaborate on...
As I'm actively developing my expertise in Quality Assurance, I'm particularly keen to collaborate on projects that offer opportunities to apply and expand my QA skills. I'm enthusiastic about contributing to initiatives focused on ensuring software quality and delivering excellent user experiences.

Specifically, I'm interested in collaborating on projects involving:

* **Test Automation:** I'm eager to gain more hands-on experience with test automation frameworks (like Selenium, Cypress, or others) and contribute to automating test suites for web, mobile, or API testing. My foundational knowledge in JavaScript can be valuable in this area.
* **Manual Testing Efforts:** I'm ready to contribute to manual testing activities, including functional testing, regression testing, exploratory testing, and usability testing. I can assist with test case design, execution, and clear bug reporting using tools like JIRA.
* **Bug Identification and Reporting:** With a keen eye for detail and analytical skills honed through IT management and data analysis, I can contribute significantly to identifying, documenting, and tracking defects effectively using JIRA.
* **Applying Agile Methodologies to QA:** I'm interested in projects that embrace Agile principles (Scrum, Kanban) and where I can contribute to integrating QA seamlessly into the development lifecycle.
* **Performance Testing (Beginner Level):** While still developing in this area, I'm eager to learn and contribute to basic performance testing efforts, potentially using tools like JMeter, to ensure application responsiveness and stability.
* **Open Source QA Projects:** I'm open to contributing to open-source projects focused on quality assurance tools, frameworks, or testing methodologies to learn from experienced professionals and contribute to the community.
* **Proof of Concepts (PoCs) and Side Projects:** I'm happy to collaborate on smaller proof-of-concept projects or side initiatives where I can apply QA principles and contribute to the overall quality of the deliverable.

**My potential contributions include:**

* Developing and executing test cases based on requirements and specifications.
* Identifying, documenting, and tracking bugs and issues in JIRA.
* Contributing to the automation of test scripts (especially with JavaScript).
* Participating in test planning and strategy discussions.
* Providing feedback on usability and potential areas for improvement.
* Applying my analytical skills to understand data related to testing outcomes.
* Leveraging my strong communication skills (fluent in English and Portuguese) for effective collaboration.

If you have a project that aligns with my interests and where I can contribute my growing QA skillset, please don't hesitate to reach out! I'm a quick learner, a collaborative team player, and dedicated to ensuring quality outcomes.
